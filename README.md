# ASTEROID FIELD 3001

An infinite runner where you fling your ship away from incoming asteroids, racking up points the longer you manage to avoid a bit of space rock whacking you in the face. An adaption of [Ah Crap, Asteroid Field!](https://github.com/neromaki/ah-crap-asteroid-field).

Made in [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io/) for [One Giant Leap game jam](https://onegiantleap-leicester.co.uk/gamejam).

Game is in `index.html`, accompanying mobile controller in `controller.html`.
